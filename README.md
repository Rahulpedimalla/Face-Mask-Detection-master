# Face-Mask-Detection-master
Face Mask Detection project uses deep learning to detect masks in real-time video streams. It leverages MobileNetV2 and OpenCV to classify faces as “with mask” or “without mask.” Includes training and detection scripts with data augmentation for robust performance. Ideal for learning computer vision and AI.
